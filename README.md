## General Information
- For this project, I used html and css to create a virtual portfolio website highlighting my experiences, education, etc. I then created a static web app via Azure from this Github repository and linked it with my custom domain. 
- This website will allow recruiters, friends and family to view my up to date experiences. Although the apps like LinkedIn also serve this purpose, this allows me to showcase my technology and coding skills which is relevant to my career in analytics.



## Technologies Used

- Github
- Azure


## Features
- Home page with photo
